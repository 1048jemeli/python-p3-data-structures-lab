# Data Structures Lab

## Learning Goals

- 
- Execute and test Python code using the Python shell and `pytest`.

## Key Vocab

- **Sequence**: a data structure in which data is stored and accessed in a
specific order.
- **Index**: the location, represented by an integer, of an element in a
sequence.
- **Iterable**: able to be broken down into smaller parts of equal size that
can be processed in turn. You can loop through any iterable object.
- **Slice**: a group of neighboring elements in a sequence.
- **Mutable**: an object that can be changed.
- **Immutable**: an object that cannot be changed. (_Many immutable objects
appear mutable because programmers reuse their names for new objects_.)
- **List**: a mutable data type in Python that can store many types of data.
The most common data structure in Python.
- **Tuple**: an immutable data type in Python that can store many types of
data.
- **Range**: a data type in Python that stores integers in a fixed pattern.
- **String**: an immutable data type in Python that stores unicode characters
in a fixed pattern. Iterable and indexed, just like other sequences.

## Introduction

## Instructions

Time to get some practice! Write your code in the `data_structures.py` file in
the `lib` folder. Run `pytest -x` to check your work. Your goal is to practice
manipulating sequences with the Python tools you've learned about in this
lesson and the lessons before.

When all of your tests are passing, submit your work using `git`.
